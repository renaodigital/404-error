day 1
raining bulls, draining tools
trying to lead my way of statement
changing the road of my heart
new, commited to a good restart.



day 2
brand new options
lonely occupations
recentment that turned my soul deep
down low
so slow
no, trouble.

day 3
< lead the pew />
ways to make to take the top down
to make the triple a double down (clown)
keeping my changes in town, orange is the new brown?
generating my own
constance, distance.

{ silence
          }

< pow pow />

about the exercise
of being more one mind
one more kind

to bend
to expend
til' da end.



day 15
i take from good some bad
some bad to being free
and learn, to be or not, see

watch u, doesn't forget that is important
to talk, to walk
the view, some mills, off road

overloaded
surrounded
off bed

solitude
silence.


day 16
chosen one
talking in one tone
relating some one

some?
sliding, riding, rolling
some big ups

some roll ups
to go cryp: to
by: being me
